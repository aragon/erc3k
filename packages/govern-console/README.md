## Govern Console

Govern Console is a minimal frontend to manage your optimistic DAO. You'll be able to manage your DAO configuration, permissions, and actions currently in the queue.

## Quick start

Install with yarn and launch the app with yarn start. By default, the app is configured to connect to the Ethereum Rinkeby testnet, but there's a chain selector so you can change them on the fly.

## Contributing

Don't be shy to contribute even the smallest tweak. üê≤ There are still some dragons to be aware of, but we'll be here to help you get started!
